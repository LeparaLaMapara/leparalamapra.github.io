# 🤖 From Algorithms to Impact: My AI Journey in the Insurance Industry


Early in my career, I was captivated by the allure of complex algorithms. 🧠 I spent countless hours fine-tuning models, obsessing over accuracy metrics, and pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. However, as I gained more experience, especially during my time in the insurance industry, I realized that while the technical aspects of AI are crucial, they’re just one part of the equation. The real measure of success is how these models impact the business—how they translate into monetary value and align with strategic goals. 💰

## A Personal Shift in Perspective

I remember a specific moment at the insurance company that marked a turning point in my approach to AI. We were working on a telematics rewards model designed to assess driving behavior and reward safe drivers with premium discounts. Initially, I was engrossed in the technical challenge of refining the model's accuracy. However, as the project progressed, it became clear that despite the model's precision, the real value was not being fully realized.

The business stakeholders were primarily concerned with how quickly the model could process data and its direct impact on customer retention and cost savings. This was a wake-up call for me. I realized that even the most sophisticated model is of little use if it doesn't deliver tangible business benefits. I began to shift my focus from pure technical excellence to aligning our solutions with the company’s strategic goals. 🎯

## Overcoming Challenges and Delivering Impact

At the insurance company, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the limited compute resources available for processing the telematics data. The production environment was constrained, and processing the backlog of trip data was taking far too long, leading to customer dissatisfaction. The solution I proposed was not only to optimize the model but also to scale up the resources and implement parallel processing to speed up the data pipeline.

The results were immediate and significant. By reducing the trip processing time, we improved the customer experience, leading to higher engagement with the rewards program. This directly translated into a reduction in claims costs by 15%, contributing to the company's bottom line. 💼

Another key project was the flood risk model for property insurance. Initially, I was drawn to the complexity of the algorithms involved. 🌊 However, I quickly realized that the true value came from how quickly we could assess risks and underwrite new policies. The model we developed reduced risk assessment time by 50%, enabling faster policy issuance and reducing potential claims payouts. This not only sped up the underwriting process but also allowed the company to avoid significant potential losses, further demonstrating the importance of aligning AI solutions with business strategies.

## Aligning AI with Business Strategy

These experiences in the insurance industry taught me that the true power of AI lies not in its complexity but in its ability to deliver measurable business value. 💡 I learned to ask critical questions before diving into any project: How does this model benefit the business? How does it align with our strategic objectives? And most importantly, how can we measure its success in meaningful ways?

For example, when the management team informed us of the need to adhere to a strict API request limit to avoid additional charges, I knew this challenge had to be tackled with both technical and strategic foresight. By ensuring that the model we developed respected these limits while still processing the necessary data, we avoided unnecessary costs and ensured that our solution was both technically sound and strategically aligned.

As Geoffrey Moore famously said, "Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway." 🚦 But I’ve come to realize that it’s not just about having data—it’s about leveraging it to drive actionable insights that align with business goals.

## Lessons Learned and Moving Forward

The journey hasn’t been without its challenges. In the insurance industry, I encountered an environment where data science principles were still being established. This meant that beyond developing models, I also had to introduce foundational tools like GitHub, Confluence, and Jira to ensure that our work was scalable and aligned with the broader business strategy.

Eliyahu M. Goldratt’s perspective, "Tell me how you will measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave," resonates deeply with me. It’s a principle that now guides my approach, ensuring that every AI project I work on is measured not just by its technical merits but by the business outcomes it drives. 📊

## Conclusion 

In the world of AI, it’s easy to get lost in technical details. 🛠️ But my experiences in the insurance industry have taught me that the real value of AI comes from its impact on the business. By focusing on monetary value, time efficiency, and strategic alignment, we ensure that our work not only pushes the boundaries of what’s possible but also delivers real, measurable results. 📈✨

**So, how do you measure the impact of your models and ensure alignment within your organization?** 🤔 Have you faced similar challenges where aligning AI with business strategy made all the difference? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
