# 🤖 From Algorithms to Impact: My AI Journey in the Insurance Industry

Early in my career, I was captivated by the allure of complex algorithms. 🧠 I was like Naruto learning Rasengan—obsessed, determined, and probably overcomplicating things more than necessary. I spent countless hours fine-tuning models, obsessing over accuracy metrics, and pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. But as I leveled up, much like Luffy unlocking Gear Second, I realized that while the technical aspects of AI are crucial, they’re just one part of the equation. The real Hokage-level success is how these models impact the business—how they translate into monetary value and align with strategic goals. 💰

## A Personal Shift in Perspective

Let me take you back to a specific moment at the insurance company that felt like my own Chūnin Exams. We were working on a telematics rewards model designed to assess driving behavior and reward safe drivers with premium discounts. Initially, I was caught up in the technical challenge, like a shinobi trying to perfect their jutsu. However, as the project progressed, it became as clear as day that despite the model’s precision, the real value was still in the Hidden Leaf Village—aka, the business impact wasn't fully realized.

The business stakeholders, much like the Hokage council, were primarily concerned with how quickly the model could process data and its direct impact on customer retention and cost savings. This was a real wake-up call, a kind of “Dobe” moment, if you will. I realized that even the most sophisticated model is about as useful as Usopp's lies if it doesn't deliver tangible business benefits. That’s when I began to shift my focus from pure technical excellence to aligning our solutions with the company’s strategic goals. 🎯

## Overcoming Challenges and Delivering Impact

At the insurance company, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the limited compute resources available for processing the telematics data—think of it like Luffy trying to fight Kaido with just a stick. The production environment was constrained, and processing the backlog of trip data was taking far too long, leading to customer dissatisfaction. The solution I proposed was not only to optimize the model but also to scale up the resources and implement parallel processing to speed up the data pipeline—kind of like calling in Zoro and Sanji for backup.

The results were immediate and significant. By reducing the trip processing time, we improved the customer experience, leading to higher engagement with the rewards program. This directly translated into a reduction in claims costs by 15%, contributing to the company's bottom line. 💼

Now, let’s talk about another adventure—the flood risk model for property insurance. Initially, I was drawn to the complexity of the algorithms involved, like Luffy drawn to meat (or, let’s be real, any kind of food). 🌊 However, I quickly realized that the real value came from how easily the model could be surfaced and used by our business teams. Instead of trying to create a model as complex as the Grand Line, we focused on making it as user-friendly as Chopper's Rumble Balls. By simplifying the interface and ensuring the model’s output was easy to integrate into existing workflows, we reduced risk assessment time by 50%, enabling faster policy issuance and reducing potential claims payouts. This approach not only sped up the underwriting process but also allowed the company to avoid significant potential losses—proving that sometimes, simpler is better.

## Aligning AI with Business Strategy

These experiences in the insurance industry taught me that the true power of AI lies not in its complexity but in its ability to deliver measurable business value. 💡 It’s kind of like when Naruto learned that being a Hokage wasn’t just about being the strongest ninja but about protecting and improving the lives of the people in the village. I learned to ask critical questions before diving into any project: How does this model benefit the business? How does it align with our strategic objectives? And most importantly, how can we measure its success in meaningful ways?

For example, when the management team informed us of the need to adhere to a strict API request limit to avoid additional charges, I knew this challenge had to be tackled with both technical and strategic foresight. By ensuring that the model we developed respected these limits while still processing the necessary data, we avoided unnecessary costs and ensured that our solution was both technically sound and strategically aligned—kind of like navigating the Grand Line without losing your ship or your sanity.

As Geoffrey Moore famously said, "Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway." 🚦 But I’ve come to realize that it’s not just about having data—it’s about leveraging it to drive actionable insights that align with business goals. Think of it as unlocking your inner Sharingan to see the bigger picture.

## Lessons Learned and Moving Forward

The journey hasn’t been without its challenges. In the insurance industry, I encountered an environment where data science principles were still being established. This meant that beyond developing models, I also had to introduce foundational tools like GitHub, Confluence, and Jira—essentially equipping the team with their own Straw Hat crew’s toolkit to ensure that our work was scalable and aligned with the broader business strategy.

Eliyahu M. Goldratt’s perspective, "Tell me how you will measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave," resonates deeply with me. It’s a principle that now guides my approach, ensuring that every AI project I work on is measured not just by its technical merits but by the business outcomes it drives. 📊 And just like Luffy doesn’t fight alone, I’ve learned the importance of collaboration and alignment to achieve those outcomes.

## Process Flow
These days, I follow this flow for any use case, kind of like sticking to my own ninja way:

## Conclusion

In the world of AI, it’s easy to get lost in technical details. 🛠️ But my experiences in the insurance industry have taught me that the real value of AI comes from its impact on the business. By focusing on monetary value, time efficiency, and strategic alignment, we ensure that our work not only pushes the boundaries of what’s possible but also delivers real, measurable results. 📈✨

So, how do you measure the impact of your models and ensure alignment within your organization? 🤔 Have you faced similar challenges where aligning AI with business strategy made all the difference? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
