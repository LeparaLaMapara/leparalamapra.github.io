# 🌌 How do Astrophysicists Model the Cosmos?

*Northern Cape Night Sky*

Whenever we look up at the night sky, we can’t help but feel a gravitational pull towards the dark mysteries that drive the universe. 🌠 I’ve always wondered how all these celestial bodies—planets, stars, galaxies—came to be. Why are planets round, and why do galaxies form these elegant spirals? And, how on Earth (literally) do astronomers figure out how the universe ticks? These questions often vanish as we get bogged down by daily routines of work, life, and the never-ending quest for Wi-Fi. 📶

But fear not! This article is here to rekindle your curiosity, offering a quick glimpse into how we can play with the universe—because yes, astrophysicists are like big kids with cosmic toys. 🧸

In the past, long before telescopes and supercomputers, African civilizations had their own way of understanding the heavens. 🌍 The ancient people of Mali, for instance, used the stars for navigation and to mark the seasons. They didn’t need a PhD to figure out when it was time to plant crops—just a clear night sky and a bit of common sense. 🌾

Fast forward to today, and the torch has been passed to those who feel an equal but opposite gravitational pull towards the universe's call. These individuals, known as astronomers or astrophysicists, study the physical laws governing the universe’s inner workings. Sure, it sounds profound, but let’s be honest—how can our tiny minds grasp the vastness of the cosmos? 🌌 Well, just like kids "ko kasi" (in the hood) with their toys, astrophysicists have their own tools to play with. And what better toy than the universe itself?

You see, to understand how the universe works, astrophysicists must first master the rules of the game. 🎮 This is where they start bending physical laws to see what happens when you push the universe’s buttons.

Take the ancient Egyptians, for example, who were already bending the rules with their intricate knowledge of astronomy. They aligned the pyramids with the stars—something that would make any modern-day astrophysicist green with envy. 🌟 These ancient civilizations were modeling the cosmos in their own way, long before simulations became a thing.

Speaking of simulations, modern-day cosmologists use two types to understand the universe. The first is an N-body simulation, which models how dark matter (yes, that mysterious stuff) collapses under gravity. When paired with semi-analytical models, these simulations give us a peek into how galaxies form. It’s like watching a cosmic dance, except everyone’s invisible—dark matter is the ultimate wallflower. 💃🏾

*Galaxies are distributed along a cosmic web in the universe. “Mpc/h” is a unit of galactic distance (1 Mpc/h is more than 3.2 million light-years).*

The second type is a hydrodynamical N-body simulation. This one is the real showstopper, as it lets us see how normal matter (the stuff we actually know) interacts with dark matter under gravitational collapse to form galaxies. 🌠 Imagine trying to build a sandcastle during a windy day at the beach—that’s what these simulations deal with. But instead of sand, they’re working with gas particles that fall into dark matter valleys, eventually mixing and forming stars through a process called hydrodynamics.

And let me tell you, hydrodynamical simulations aren’t for the faint of heart. 💻 They can take up millions of hours of supercomputing time—because why do anything simple when you can make a supercomputer sweat? 😅

But why go through all this trouble? Well, these cosmic toys help answer one of the most basic questions in existence: “Why is everything in the universe the way it is today?”

So, in a way, astronomers and astrophysicists are still doing what our ancestors did—playing with the universe to understand our place in it. Whether it’s aligning pyramids with the stars or running complex simulations, the goal remains the same: to satisfy that gravitational pull of curiosity that draws us to the night sky. ✨

And that’s how astronomers like to play with their toys. This article was just a quick intro to the methods used for simulating the universe. Who knows? Maybe one day, you’ll find yourself playing with these cosmic toys too. 🚀

But then, as we peer deeper into the cosmos, more questions arise. How much more is out there beyond what we can simulate? 🌠 Could ancient knowledge hold keys to questions we’ve yet to answer? 🌍 And most intriguingly, how will our understanding of the universe evolve in the next few centuries—will we find new ways to play with these cosmic toys, or discover entirely new games? 🎮✨
